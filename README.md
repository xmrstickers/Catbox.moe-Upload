# Why? 
I like to share files with strangers on the internet. This website will temporarily host files up to 200 megs and provide a link to your file. 
Using this on my desktop workstation is fast and easy in the browser, but I wanted to be able to share files from CLI or other scripts on the same platform. So I made this tool! 

# Why can't I upload multiple files at once >:(
eagerly awaiting your PR, king :)
